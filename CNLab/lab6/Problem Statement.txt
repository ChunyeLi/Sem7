h1 connected to r1 (router) which is connected to r2 (router)       [h1 <--> r1 <--> r2]
We don't know the password of r1 - It is "user@x" where we need to find x.

1. First find the maximum possible mtu which we can send (without fragmentation) from h1 to r2. This is the value of x mentioned above
    -> r2 IP address using ifconfig - 192.168.1.2
    -> Use 'hping' to find the size (-d flag argument) at which fragmentation occurs
        COMMAND: sudo hping3 -1 -y -d 396 192.168.101.2
        -1 is for icmp
        -y is to set don't fragment flag
    -> Fragmentation first occurs at 396. So, mtu is (395 + (header_size = 28 (as ICMP header size is of 8 bytes))) = 423

2. Login to r1 which contains file ipfrag.tar.gz. This tar file has around 540 small files each of which is a fragment of an IP packet. 
    Of the 540 fragments only 54 are correct (check the checksum in the header) and others has errors. 
    Use IPv4 header format to read the fragments and combine the correct fragments to generate three messages.
    The message number corresponding to a fragment can be identified with the help of id field in the header and its sequence number in the 
    header, with the help of offset.

3. Tell the message along with source and destination of the message.

Notes -
-> Networking data are always stored in network order (big endian) - so they can be read using normal character array.
-> The 16-bit IP checksum should be 0xFFFF (during verification).
-> ID and offset fields need not be contiguous.
