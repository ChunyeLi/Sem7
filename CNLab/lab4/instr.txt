CRC as well as DATA link layer protocol

lab4 network 
h1 - 192.168.1.2 to h2 - 192.168.1.2: delay is 50 millisecond, error prob is 40%.
h2 to h1: does not have delay, error prob is 10%.
small stack, application, link, physical.
open, unzip, make will create protocol
./protocol 192.168.1.2 8500 8500
./protocol 192.168.1.1 8500 8500
