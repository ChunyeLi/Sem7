\frametitle{Register Allocation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Now that we have made our interference graph, where each edge denotes that its endpoints must go in different registers, thus, our problem reduced into coloring our graph with K (\# no. of available registers) colors such that no two end points have same colour.
  \end{itemize}
