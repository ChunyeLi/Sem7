## Defn

Whistle-blowing can be defined as the release of information by a
member or former member of an organization that is evidence of illegal and/or immoral conduct
in the organization or conduct in the organization that is not in the public interest.

## Loyal Agent Argument

According to one argument, an employee is an agent of an employer. An agent is a person who
is engaged to act in the interests of another person (called a principal) and is authorized to act on
that person’s behalf. This relationship is typical of professionals, such as lawyers and accountants.

The loyal agent argument receives considerable support from the law, where the concept of
agency and the obligations of agents are well developed. 

The main obligation of an agent is to act in the interest of the principal. We expect a lawyer,
for example, to act as we would ourselves, if we had the same ability. This obligation is expressed
in the Second Restatement of Agency as follows: “an agent is subject to a duty to his principal to act
solely for the benefit of the principal in all matters connected with his agency.

## Are Whistle-Blowers Disloyal Agents?

Although employees have an obligation of loyalty that is not shared by a person outside the orga-
nization, the obligation is not without its limits. Whistle-blowing is not something to be done
without adequate justification, but at the same time, it is not something that can never be justified.

Second Restatement, to
obey all reasonable directives of the principal. This is interpreted to exclude illegal or immoral
acts; that is, employees are not obligated as agents to do anything illegal or immoral—even if
specifically instructed by a superior to do so.

The law of agency further excludes an obligation to keep confidential any information
about the commission of a crime. Section 395 of the Second Restatement of Agency reads in part:
“An agent is privileged to reveal information confidentially acquired . . . in the protection of a
superior interest of himself or a third person.”

## Conditions for Justified Whistle-Blowing

1. Is the situation of sufficient moral importance to justify whistle-blowing? A cover-up of lethal side effects in a newly marketed drug, for example, is an appropriate situation for disclosure because people’s lives are at stake. But situations are not always this clear. 
2. Do you have all the facts and have you properly understood their significance? Whistle-blowing usually involves very serious charges that can cause irreparable harm if they turn out to be unfounded or misinterpreted.
3.  Have all internal channels and steps short of whistle-blowing been exhausted? Whistle- blowing should be a last rather than a first resort. It is justified only when there are no morally preferable alternatives. Virtually every organization requires employees to take up any matter of concern with an immediate superior before proceeding further—unless that person is part of the problem.
4. What is the best way to blow the whistle? Once a decision is made to “go public,” a host of other questions have to be answered. To whom should the information be revealed? How much information should be revealed? Should the information be revealed anonymously or accompanied by the identity of the whistle-blower? Often an anonymous complaint to a regulatory body, such as the Environmental Protection Agency or the Securities and Exchange Commission, is sufficient to spark an investigation. The situation might also be handled by contacting the FBI or a local prosecuting attorney or by leaking information to the local press. 
5. What is my responsibility in view of my role in the organization? The justification for blowing the whistle depends not only on the wrongdoing of others but also on the particular role that a whistle-blower occupies in an organization. Thus, an employee is more justified in blowing the whistle—and may even have an obligation to do so—when the wrongdoing concerns matters over which the employee has direct responsibility. 
6. What are the chances for success? Insofar as whistle-blowing is justified because of some good to the public, it is important to blow the whistle only when there is a reasonable chance of achieving that good.
